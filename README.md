# Comic-Auction
Finally an auction app for the rest of us.

## Getting started

```bash
sbt update
sbt run
```

This should start the demo where Bill is enthusiastically bidding on the comic with the first appearance of Squirrel Girl.

## Running with Eclipse

Requires [sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse/ "Sbteclipse Plugin") to be added in a plugin either at the project or global level 

```bash
sbt eclipse
```

## Requirements

Support has been tested on:

* Scala >=2.11
* sbt   >=13
